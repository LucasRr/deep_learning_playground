This repo is meant to be a playground to implement and benchmark various deep learning models, in Pytorch. For example, we test various MLP or CNN-based architectures, different regularization strategies and optimizers, and test the robustness of some models against noise or translations. We evaluate on various applications such as classification, denoising or compression.

Example projects:

- MLP_models: test various MLP architectures  
- CNN_models: test various CNN architectures  
- robust_classification: test robustness or various models to translation or noise  
- Network visualization: visualize networks, using for example activation maximization  
- Autoencoders: autoencoder architectures, image compression or denoising
